# ServerSentry v2 - Quick Start Guide

‚ö° **Get ServerSentry monitoring up and running in 5 minutes**

This guide will have you monitoring your server with intelligent alerting in just a few simple steps.

## Prerequisites

- Linux, macOS, or Unix-like system
- Bash 5.0+ installed
- Basic command line familiarity

## Step 1: Install ServerSentry (2 minutes)

### Option A: Quick Install

```bash
# One-line installer (recommended)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/ServerSentry/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Option B: Manual Install

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ServerSentry.git
cd ServerSentry
chmod +x bin/serversentry

# Add to PATH (optional but recommended)
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
serversentry version
# Should show: ServerSentry v2.0.0
```

## Step 2: Basic Configuration (1 minute)

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Run interactive configuration wizard
serversentry configure
```

The wizard will prompt you for:

- **Monitoring thresholds** (use defaults for now)
- **Notification preferences** (skip for basic monitoring)
- **Check interval** (60 seconds is recommended)

### Manual Configuration (Alternative)

```bash
# Basic configuration is already included
# Just verify it exists
cat config/serversentry.yaml
```

## Step 3: Test the System (1 minute)

### Check System Status

```bash
# See current system status
serversentry status
```

You should see output like:

```
‚úÖ Monitoring service is stopped
‚úÖ cpu: OK (45%) - Normal CPU usage
‚úÖ memory: OK (62%) - Normal memory usage
‚úÖ disk: OK (34%) - Normal disk usage
```

### Run System Diagnostics

```bash
# Verify everything is working
serversentry diagnostics quick
```

### Test Individual Plugins

```bash
# Test each monitoring component
serversentry check cpu
serversentry check memory
serversentry check disk
```

## Step 4: Start Monitoring (30 seconds)

### Start the Monitoring Service

```bash
# Begin continuous monitoring
serversentry start
```

### Verify Service is Running

```bash
# Check that monitoring is active
serversentry status
```

You should now see:

```
‚úÖ Monitoring service is running (PID: 12345)
```

## Step 5: Explore Features (30 seconds)

### View Real-time Logs

```bash
# See monitoring activity in real-time
tail -f logs/serversentry.log
```

### List Available Commands
