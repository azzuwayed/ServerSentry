# ServerSentry Codebase Analysis Summary

Analysis Date: Thu May 22 02:34:57 +03 2025

## Overview

- **Total Files:** 51
- **Total Lines of Code:** 8388
- **Shell Script Files:**       32
- **Shell Script Lines:** 6270

## Key Findings

1. **Directory Structure**: The project has       17 directories.
2. **Module Dependencies**: Found      102 source statements across the codebase.
3. **Code Smells**: Identified potentially long functions, hardcoded values, and error handling issues.

## Recommendations for v2 Refactoring

1. **Modularization**: Break down large files and functions into smaller, more focused components.
2. **Configuration Management**: Replace hardcoded values with a centralized configuration system.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling throughout the codebase.
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests for core functionality.
5. **Documentation**: Improve inline documentation and create comprehensive API references.

## Next Steps

1. Review the detailed reports in the refactoring_analysis directory.
2. Prioritize areas for refactoring based on complexity and impact.
3. Create a detailed implementation plan for each component.
4. Set up a development environment for v2 with proper testing infrastructure.

See the V2_REFACTORING_PLAN.md document for the complete refactoring strategy.
