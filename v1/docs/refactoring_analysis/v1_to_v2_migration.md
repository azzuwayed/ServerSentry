# ServerSentry v1 â†’ v2 Migration Tracking

This document tracks the migration status of all v1 runtime `.sh` files to v2, summarizing their purpose, v2 equivalents, migration status, and notes. Any v1 logic not found in v2 is highlighted below.

---

## Summary

- **Complete/Improved:** Most core logic (monitoring, CLI, notifications, periodic, config, log) is migrated and improved in v2.
- **Partial/Missing:** Some helpers (e.g., install script, generic webhook logic, some CLI visual helpers) are not directly ported or are handled differently.
- **See notes for each file for details.**

## Notable v1 Logic Not Found in v2

- **install.sh:** No unified install script in v2; setup may be manual or handled differently.
- **config_compatibility.sh:** No backward compatibility layer for v1 config in v2.
- **Generic webhook support:** v2 focuses on named providers (Teams, Slack, Discord, Email); generic webhook logic may need to be re-implemented if required.
- **Some CLI visual helpers:** Progress bars, colorized output, and interactive menus are less prominent in v2 CLI (but TUI is improved).
