# ShellCheck configuration for ServerSentry v3.0
# Enhanced configuration for bash script linting

# Core project exclusions
# SC1091: Not following sourced files (expected for modular design)
# This is common in projects with configuration files and libraries
disable=SC1091

# Additional common exclusions (uncomment as needed):

# SC2034: Variable appears unused
# Useful for color variables and configuration that may be used in sourced files
# disable=SC1091,SC2034

# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting
# Sometimes intentional for certain patterns
# disable=SC1091,SC2086

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# Sometimes acceptable for simple assignments
# disable=SC1091,SC2155

# SC2181: Check exit code directly with e.g. 'if mycmd;', not indirectly with $?
# Legacy code may use this pattern intentionally
# disable=SC1091,SC2181

# File-specific configurations can also be added:
# For files that need multiple exclusions, use individual disable comments

# Example of a comprehensive disable for heavily customized scripts:
# disable=SC1091,SC2034,SC2086,SC2155,SC2181

# Project-specific patterns:
# - Scripts in bin/ may need SC2155 disabled for installer patterns
# - Library files in lib/ may need SC2034 for exported variables
# - Demo scripts may need relaxed rules for readability

# To disable warnings for specific script sections:
# Use: # shellcheck disable=SC#### in the script itself
