- ✅ Logging system (`lib/core/logging.sh`)
- ✅ Plugin architecture (`lib/core/plugin.sh`)
- ✅ Utilities (`lib/core/utils.sh`)
- ✅ Notification system (`lib/core/notification.sh`)
- ✅ Periodic monitoring (`lib/core/periodic.sh`)

### Plugins

- ✅ CPU monitoring plugin (`lib/plugins/cpu/cpu.sh`)
- ✅ Memory monitoring plugin (`lib/plugins/memory/memory.sh`)
- ✅ Disk monitoring plugin (`lib/plugins/disk/disk.sh`)
- ✅ Process monitoring plugin (`lib/plugins/process/process.sh`)

### Notification Providers

- ✅ Microsoft Teams integration (`lib/notifications/teams/teams.sh`)
- ✅ Slack integration (`lib/notifications/slack/slack.sh`)
- ✅ Discord integration (`lib/notifications/discord/discord.sh`)
- ✅ Email integration (`lib/notifications/email/email.sh`)

### User Interface

- ✅ Command-line interface (`lib/ui/cli/commands.sh`)
- ⚠️ Text-based user interface (directory created but implementation incomplete)

### Documentation

- ✅ Directory structure for docs created
- ⚠️ API documentation (directory created but content incomplete)
- ⚠️ Developer documentation (directory created but content incomplete)
- ⚠️ User documentation (directory created but content incomplete)

### Testing

- ✅ Unit test framework set up (`tests/unit/utils_test.sh`)
- ⚠️ Integration tests (directory created but tests incomplete)

## 🔄 Partially Completed

### Infrastructure

- ✅ Directory structure
- ✅ Main executable (`bin/serversentry`)
- ✅ Installation script (`bin/install.sh`)

### Configuration

- ✅ Core configuration structure
- ⚠️ Default plugin configurations incomplete
- ⚠️ Default notification provider configurations incomplete

## ❌ Pending Components

### Notification Providers

- ✅ Complete Discord integration implementation
- ✅ Complete Email notification integration

### User Interface

- ❌ Complete TUI implementation for interactive mode
- ❌ Add tab completion for CLI

### Documentation

- ❌ Complete user documentation
- ❌ Complete developer guides
- ❌ Add plugin development guide
- ❌ Add notification provider development guide
- ❌ Finalize API documentation

### Testing

- ❌ Add comprehensive unit tests for all components
- ❌ Implement integration tests
- ❌ Add cross-platform compatibility tests

### Installation and Setup

- ✅ Migrate installation script from v1 to v2 (`bin/install.sh`)

## 🔄 Migration Statistics

- **Components Completed**: 17
- **Components Partially Completed**: 6
- **Components Pending**: 10
- **Overall Completion**: ~65%

## Technical Debt and Issues

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Some implementations might need adjustment for better compatibility across different Linux distributions and macOS versions.

2. **Bash Version Compatibility**: Some scripts may use features not available in older Bash versions. Need to ensure compatibility with Bash 5.x.

3. **Error Handling**: While improved from v1, some error handling paths may need further refinement.

4. **Documentation**: Inline code documentation is present but could be enhanced.

## Next Steps

1. Finalize TUI implementation
2. Enhance documentation, especially developer guides
3. Expand test coverage
4. Implement API documentation

## Migration Notes

- The v2 implementation follows a more modular plugin-based architecture as specified in the refactoring plan.
- Configuration has been centralized and standardized.
- The notification system has been redesigned with a provider-based approach.
- Error handling has been improved throughout the codebase.
- The periodic monitoring system has been enhanced with better scheduling and reporting capabilities.
